🛡️ Target Data Collector

Target Data Collector is a C++ console-based Data Management System that uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) to efficiently store, search, and manage personal information of individuals.
It is designed for tracking, referencing, and analyzing user data in an organized manner.

🌟 Features

Insert Records – Add new individuals with Name, Age, and Address

Search Records – Quickly find a person by their name

Display Records – Show all stored records in sorted order using inorder traversal

Remove Records – Safely remove a person while handling:

Leaf nodes

Nodes with one child

Nodes with two children

Duplicate Prevention – Ensures no two entries share the same name

💻 Technology Used

C++ – Core programming language

⚠️ Notes

Data is stored in memory and not persisted in files

Designed for learning and simulation purposes

Prevents duplicate names to maintain data integrity

🔒 Cyber Security Relevance

This project demonstrates organized data storage, search, and access control, which are fundamental concepts in Cyber Security.
Efficiently managing personal information while ensuring proper handling and retrieval simulates real-world secure data management practices.
